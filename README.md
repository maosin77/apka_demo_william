## what is this ?
### william-demo
This project is quick overview of my coding style. Of course I realize that many things should be done differently, but this was just a sample of how I write code, so I hope that no one expected a second facebook, or beautiful styling :) 

## no backend, no cry..
### dexie.js
In this project we did not have a time to implement backend, so we used indexedDb to hold the data. If you want to clear the data you see in application please clear cache or open App in incognito mode.

## how to run?
### `yarn && yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
